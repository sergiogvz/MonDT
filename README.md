# MonDT - Decision Trees for Classification with Monotonic Constraints

This repository implements two different decision trees for monotonic classification:

- Rank Discrimination Measure Tree  (RDMT). This decision tree can be built with three different rank discrimination measures: Gini, Shannon, or Pessimistic.
